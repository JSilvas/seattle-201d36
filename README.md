## Lecture Notes from class

Lecture Notes will be placed in each class' lecture-code subdirectory as a markdown file after they are presented.  

## Assignments

Lab-time code assignments follow each class time. You can find these assignments in the subdirectories of each class folder. Assignment content will very from day to day, depending on the topic. Some of the lab assignments will be pair programming assignments.

Instructions for completing and submitting the assignments can be found in the README files of the appropriate subdirectories.

Assignments are submitted using a professional-grade git-flow. If you haven't done so already, it's time to get comfortable with the core git commands. Don't worry, we'll give you step by step help as needed.
